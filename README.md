Search aggregator that queries multiple engines and shows results in one place. You can add custom search engines, bang-command plugins, slot plugins (query-triggered panels above/below results or in the sidebar), and transports (custom HTTP fetch strategies like curl, FlareSolverr, or your own). The dream would be to eventually have a user made marketplace for plugins/engines.

**Now in stable beta.** You can use it in production but there may be _some_ inconsistent behaviour.

Please check the [documentation](https://degoog-org.github.io/docs/) before raising issues, your questions may already have been answered.

## Run

By default the app will run on port `4444` with user `1000:1000`, please check the [documentation](https://degoog-org.github.io/docs/env.html) for a comprehensive list of env variables and various nuances.

```bash
mkdir -p ./data
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 ./data
```

<summary>Docker Compose</summary>

Ready-to-use compose files live in [`docker-compose-examples/`](docker-compose-examples/). Pick the one that fits:

| File | What it runs | When to use |
| :--- | :----------- | :---------- |
| [`simple.yml`](docker-compose-examples/simple.yml) | degoog only | Personal use, low-traffic |
| [`valkey.yml`](docker-compose-examples/valkey.yml) | degoog + Valkey | Multi-replica or public instance with shared cache keeps settings and invalidation in sync |
| [`postgres.yml`](docker-compose-examples/postgres.yml) | degoog + Postgres | Busy public instance with a large indexer - Postgres scales concurrent writes and FTS better than SQLite |
| [`full.yml`](docker-compose-examples/full.yml) | degoog + Valkey + Postgres | High-traffic public instance - both shared cache and scalable indexer |
| [`mcp.yml`](docker-compose-examples/mcp.yml) | degoog + [degoog-mcp](mcp/README.md) | Exposing Degoog to LLMs / MCP clients (Claude, Cursor, llama.cpp) next to the web UI |

## Public instances

Some amazing people around the web decided to make their degoog instances available for everyone to use, and they 100% deserve a shout-out! Check out the full list [here](./PUBLIC_INSTANCES.md)

## Store repositories

Aside from the official store repo community members have been working hard on their own plugins and been sharing them with everyone who wants to enhance their degoog experience. **You can find a bunch of them [here](https://degoog-org.github.io/community-extensions)**.

_**Note:** These have only been INITIALLY vetted, there is no way for me to keep an eye on them once they have been added to the community store repo. If your own responsibiilty to make sure what you install on your system is safe._

## Documentation

Full customisation guide (plugins, themes, engines, transports, store, settings gate, aliases, env): **[documentation](https://degoog-org.github.io/docs)**.

## Little shoutout

This project would have never existed if the amazing [searxng](https://github.com/searxng/searxng) developers hadn't had the idea first. This is my take on a heavily customisable search aggregrator, it's meant to be a more modular lighter alternative, you can add as much as you want to it, but the core will stay as simple as it gets.

Alternatives are what make the internet a fun place, let me share a few other aggregators you may want to try out, the beauty of open source is that there's no competition (or at least there shouldn't be, none of us do this shit for money after all).
